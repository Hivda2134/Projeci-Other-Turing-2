# Data Directory

This directory contains data files used by the Resonance Guard project.

## `toxic_signals_v1.csv`

This file contains synthetic and redacted toxic signals data. It is generated by `scripts/generate_toxic_signals.py` and is used for calibrating and testing the toxic detection mechanisms within the Resonance Guard.

### Schema:

*   `text_sample`: (string) A synthetic text sample, potentially containing patterns indicative of toxicity (e.g., hex-like, base64-like strings).
*   `is_toxic`: (integer) Binary flag indicating whether the `text_sample` is synthetically marked as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).
*   `hex_like_pattern`: (integer) Binary flag indicating if the `text_sample` contains a hex-like pattern.
*   `base64_like_pattern`: (integer) Binary flag indicating if the `text_sample` contains a base64-like pattern.
*   `entropy_score`: (float) A synthetic entropy score for the `text_sample`, generally higher for toxic samples and lower for non-toxic ones.

### Generation:

This dataset is generated programmatically to ensure privacy-safe data for development and testing. It does not contain any real-world sensitive information. The generation process introduces a controlled percentage of synthetic toxic samples (e.g., 20%) to simulate real-world scenarios for model training and evaluation.
