This document provides a technical explanation of the minimal Flask application found in `high_resonance_A.py`. Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that provides tools and libraries to build web applications. Its simplicity and flexibility make it an excellent choice for rapid development and small-to-medium sized projects.

### Core Components:

1.  **Import Flask**: The line `from flask import Flask` imports the necessary `Flask` class from the `flask` library. This class is the core of the application, representing the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) application.

2.  **Initialize the Application**: `app = Flask(__name__)` creates an instance of the Flask application. The `__name__` argument is a special Python variable that gets the name of the current module. Flask uses this to know where to look for resources like templates and static files.

3.  **Route Decorator**: The `@app.route('/')` line is a decorator that tells Flask which URL should trigger our `hello_world` function. In this case, `/` represents the root URL of the application. When a user navigates to this URL, the decorated function will be executed.
