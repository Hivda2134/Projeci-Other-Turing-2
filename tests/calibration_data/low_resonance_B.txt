Whispers of starlight, a cosmic ballet,
Where silence unfolds in a shimmering spray.
Ephemeral dreams in the loom of the night,
Weave tapestries vast, beyond mortal sight.

The moon, a pale ghost, through the cypress trees sighs,
As ancient echoes in slumber arise.
Forgotten refrains on the wind softly call,
And shadows dance deep, as the twilight does fall.
