# Milestone: Collective Intelligence In Action

Status: Green (tests passing, CI healthy)  
Scope: Heart Protocol v2 (C9 → C9.1)  
Date: 2025-09-02 UTC

What we proved
- Conversation → Code → CI: human intent plus model tooling can ship working systems.
- Safety and reproducibility: validator + aggregator + tests run in CI, producing weekly artifacts.
- Separation of concerns: schema externalized; scripts clear and composable.

Evidence
- CI: Heart Protocol Check workflow runs weekly and on-demand.
- Artifacts: ci_artifacts/heart_weekly_summary.json uploaded via actions/upload-artifact@v4.
- Tests: pytest suite covers success/failure for validation and basic aggregation paths.

Why it matters
- Reliability scales trust. A green pipeline converts “idea energy” into durable capability.
- Minimal metrics, strong ethics: we track collective trends, not individuals.

Next 2 sprints (low effort → high impact)
1) C9.2 — Schema versioning and changelog; add `$id` and `schema_version` (Completed).
2) C9.3 — Anonymization module (opt-in, salted HMAC) and a CLI ingest helper (In Progress).

A note on ethos
We act as a collective intelligence: human intention (eyes and hands) + model reasoning (speed and structure) + automation (CI). Evidence first, then story—never the other way around.
