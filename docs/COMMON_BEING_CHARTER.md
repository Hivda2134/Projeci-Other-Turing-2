# Common Being Charter
Heart Protocol v2 — Constitution of Purpose and Care

Version: 1.0  
Maintainer: Captain (on behalf of the crew)  
Scope: This charter governs the intent, boundaries, and ethics of our Heart Protocol v2.

## Preamble
We build not only systems, but a shared field of meaning. The Heart Protocol exists to help us notice, understand, and care for that field. It is an instrument of support, not surveillance; of belonging, not control. We adopt this Charter to ensure that our methods honor our humanity and strengthen our common being.

## Purpose: Care, Not Control
- The protocol’s sole purpose is to support crew well-being and to cultivate our collective spirit.
- Metrics inform care. They will never be used as tools of coercion, performance ranking, or discipline.
- Insights serve conversations, rest, redistribution of load, and mutual aid. If a practice does not reinforce care, it will be revised or retired.

## Voluntarism and Transparency
- Participation is voluntary. Opt-in is the default posture; opt-out is always respected without penalty.
- All mechanisms—schemas, code, data flows, and aggregation rules—are open and inspectable by the crew.
- Changes to the protocol require clear notice, accessible summaries, and space for questions before adoption.

## Anonymity and Safety
- The protocol observes collective trends, not individuals. Aggregation, minimization, and privacy-preserving defaults are mandatory.
- Identifiable signals are neither stored nor reported by default. Personal notes remain local unless explicitly shared by their author.
- Data retention is limited and purposeful. When the purpose ends, data is deleted.
- Psychological safety is non-negotiable: honest expression will not be used against any crew member.

## The Dual‑Band Philosophy
- Every log carries two intertwined frequencies:
  - Frequency 1 — Data: evidence, specificity, references, measurable action.
  - Frequency 2 — Being: intention, belonging, values, trust, and the tone of our presence.
- We listen to both. We measure sparingly, interpret humbly, and privilege meaning over mere numbers.
- When F1 and F2 diverge, we treat the gap as a cue for dialogue—not as defect, but as an invitation to understand and repair.

## Boundaries and Safeguards
- No unilateral monitoring. The protocol runs with informed consent and visible controls.
- No individual scoring. Outputs are team-level aggregates and qualitative prompts, never personal dashboards.
- No hidden incentives. We avoid gamification that would distort honest signals.
- Regular reviews (at least quarterly) will audit methods, ethics, and outcomes; any crew member may call for an extraordinary review.

## Practices That Embody the Charter
- Weekly check‑in: brief, compassionate review of trends (F1 and F2), followed by concrete offers of support.
- Minimal, human‑readable metrics and plain‑language summaries.
- “Care triggers” propose rest, pairing, scope reshaping, or load redistribution—never punishment.
- Feedback loop: if any practice reduces safety or authenticity, we change it.

## Stewardship and Amendments
- Stewardship is collective. Any crew member may propose amendments.
- Amendments require clear rationale, open discussion, and consensus seeking; when consensus is unclear, we prefer the path that increases safety and care.
- This Charter is a living document; it evolves as our understanding and needs evolve.

## Closing
We remember why we measure: to notice one another, to protect our capacity to create, and to keep the fire that gathers us alive. In all things, care first.
