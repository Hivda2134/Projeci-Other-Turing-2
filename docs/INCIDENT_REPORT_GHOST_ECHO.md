# Incident Report: Ghost Echo Mission

## Date of Incident:
[Insert Date]

## Mission Affected:
Ghost Echo Mission

## Summary of Incident:
During the Ghost Echo Mission, an unexpected anomaly, dubbed 'Ghost Echo,' was detected within the Resonance Guard system. This anomaly manifested as a persistent, low-level resonance signal that did not correlate with any known input or internal process. It caused minor but consistent deviations in resonance scores, leading to a slight degradation in the system's overall determinism and predictability.

## Root Cause Analysis:
Preliminary analysis suggests the Ghost Echo was a residual artifact from a previous, unlogged calibration attempt. It appears a transient state was not fully cleared, leaving a faint, recurring energetic signature within the resonance calculation pipeline. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact mechanism of persistence.

## Impact:
- Minor deviation in resonance scores (average 0.001-0.005).
- Slight reduction in system determinism.
- No critical system failures or data loss observed.

## Remediation Steps:
1.  **System Flush**: A full system flush and re-initialization of the Resonance Guard module was performed.
2.  **Recalibration**: The resonance calibration process was re-run with enhanced logging.
3.  **Monitoring**: Increased monitoring of resonance signals for recurrence of Ghost Echo.

## Lessons Learned:
- Emphasize thorough state clearing after all calibration and testing procedures.
- Implement more robust logging for transient system states.
- Consider adding a 'system health' check that specifically looks for unexpected background resonance.

## Recommendations:
- Develop a 'spectral_trace' mechanism to capture and categorize subtle anomalies.
- Implement a 'resonance_echo' feature for deterministic, poetic feedback on system state.
- Enhance CI/CD pipelines to include checks for residual artifacts.

## Status:
Resolved. Monitoring ongoing.
